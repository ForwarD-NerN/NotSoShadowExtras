# NotSoShadowExtras

## Info

Addon to [AntiShadowPatch](https://modrinth.com/mod/antishadowpatch) that adds extra(non-vanilla) features that won't be included in AntiShadowPatch.


## The list of features
* Update Suppression Crash Fix **(SO & CCE)**
* Update Suppression Dupe Fix
* * Fixes the item frame and the block dupe. Item shadowing dupes aren't affected.
* Disable DataFixer Light Recalculation
* * With the changes Mojang made to the lightning engine, they added a datafixer that, when activated, forces Minecraft to recalculate light in every single chunk, which breaks EOL farms. This setting just removes the datafixer.


You can configure every setting individually notsoshadowextras_config.json
